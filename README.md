##High Priority Items

##Known Bugs + Issues
* #p1 The 24 hour wait doesn't refresh when the pet is revived.  At least not with the reset button. (clf)

##Future Implementation Options
* settings + launch screen pages
* adjust settings bars so that icons do not interfere with actual status bar.
* add additional attributes. These could be general housekeeping ones such as hygeine, or more fun ones like "majors" or "bagpipes."
